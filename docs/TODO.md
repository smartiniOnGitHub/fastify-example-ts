# fastify-example-ts - TODO

## TODO

* [x] general: update all dependencies to latest ... ok
* [x] general: remove 'standardx' and fix like in Fastify ... ok, but had to disable lint of js sources with 'standard' from npm custom command 'lint:js' (and removed its call from the more general npm custom command 'lint'), because at the moment no '*.js' sources are present; re-add and enable later if/when needed
* [x] general: add npm custom command 'lint:ts:types' to only check/validate TypeScript types ... ok, but for now it's not called from the more general npm custom command 'lint'), because at the moment no '*.d.ts' sources are present; re-add and enable later if/when needed
* [x] general: remove 'esdoc' and add 'jsdoc' instead ... ok
* [x] general: delete '.eslint' and ensure the new file '.eslint.json' is used ... wip
* [x] general: add some tests ... start to add a sample test, but need to update it to ts syntax ... wip
* [x] general: Update requirements to Node.js 12 LTS, then update output to be 'es2020', with support for ES Modules (esm) ... wip
* [x] general: update ts sources to use Fastify TypeScript definitions ... wip
* [x] general: add Docker related stuff (npm custom commands, Dockerfile/s, etc) ... wip
* [x] general: add JSON Schema to TypeScript, as seen for example [here](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/TypeScript/) (same doc seen in GitHub, only with a different style) ... wip
* [x] general: add the ability to serve favicon and a static page as home page (add related content even here), of course using related plugins ... wip
* [x] general: add more content in 'package.json', like in fastify-example (add stuff related to more tests, Docker, etc); but add a build mode that uses TypeScript (TS) watch mode (check if use it instead of usual dependency on 'nodemon') ... added npm custom command 'build:watch' that uses it, but it only compiles (without a server restart or similar, maybe 'nodemon' is needed even in this case) and not sure it takes in account even other resources (templates, etc), so maybe its configuration need to be tweaked ... wip
* [x] general: add the ability to use even JavaScript (js) files, in TypeScript compiler (options) and to check them, could be useful ... wip
* [x] general: add some types (using TS features), and ensure Fastify (and related plugins) types are resolved in the right way ... wip
* [x] general: use same Fastify plugins used in fastify-example, and ensure all is good, even types ... wip
* [x] general: enable snyk here ... wip
* [x] general: add same features of fastify-example (evolve like it), and ensure all is good ... wip

* [x] general: later update to Node.js 12 LTS (12.13.0) and so output ES2019, or better ES2020 ... wip

* [x] general: later update to Node.js 14 LTS (14.15.0) and so output ES2021; anyway, export all as native ES Modules (ESM), important; as a sample take this great example: [fastify-101 - delvedor - github](https://github.com/delvedor/fastify-101) ... wip


---------------


## DONE

* [x] general: create/update initial skeleton (from an existing example) ... ok, started from current code/skeleton of my repo [fastify-example](https://github.com/smartiniOnGitHub/fastify-example), today is 2020-06-02
* [x] general: setup project with TypeScript, and add dependencies; check if continue in a similar way of fastify-example, or instead on top of a skeleton generated by fastify cli, and update/adapt it ... start as suggested by Fastify official documentation: [TypeScript - Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/docs/TypeScript.md) ... ok
* [x] general: configure TypeScript to output modern js compatible with Node.js minimal version set here (at the moment Node.js 10 LTS), so at least ES2017; and into the '/dist' folder; see [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) for TypeScript compiler options in the 'tsconfig.json' file, and [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) for TypeScript compiler options via command-line (CLI) ... ok, and note that I specified ts output folder in root 'tsconfig.json' file, and even in 'package.json' (but here mainly to have more evidence on the output folder, used there even in other npm custom commands)
* [x] general: rename initial 'server.ts' into 'server-simple.ts', and keep it as a minimal/initial but working example ... ok, but duplicated for now; to resolve TypeScript errors update project config
* [x] general: update to use latest Fastify 3.x (released today), see at [fastify - npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify); but do it in a feature branch, to merge later into master (and before tag existing master and open a branch for fastify-2.x) ... no, this is a new project so it's good the same to use that new release directly here
* [x] general: update to use latest Fastify 3.x (current release now); and update requirements ... ok
* [x] general: keep compatibility with ES2017 for now, because it seems most of current browsers already support it, approx. 90%, as seen [here](https://web.dev/publish-modern-javascript/) ... ok
