# fastify-example-ts - TODO

## TODO

* [x] general: add lint and some tests ... wip
* [x] general: add the ability to serve favicon and a static page as home page ... wip
* [x] general: add more content in 'package.json', like in fastify-example (add stuff related to more tests, Docker, etc); but add a build mode that uses TypeScript (TS) watch mode (check if use it instead of usual dependency on 'nodemon') ... added npm custom command 'build:watch' that uses it, but it only compiles (without a server restart or similar, maybe 'nodemon' is needed even in this case) and not sure it takes in account even other resources (templates, etc), so maybe its configuration need to be tweaked ... wip
* [x] general: add the ability to use even JavaScript (js) files, in TypeScript compiler (options) and to check them, could be useful ... wip
* [x] general: add some types (using TS features), and ensure Fastify (and related plugins) types are resolved in the right way ... wip
* [x] general: use same Fastify plugins used in fastify-example, and ensure all is good, even types ... wip
* [x] general: enable snyk here ... wip
* [x] general: add same features of fastify-example (evolve like it), and ensure all is good ... wip

* [x] general: update to use latest Fastify 3.x (released today), see at [fastify - npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify); but do it in a feature branch, to merge later into master (and before tag existing master and open a branch for fastify-2.x) ... wip

* [x] general: later update to Node.js 12 LTS and so output ES2019 ... wip


---------------


## DONE

* [x] general: create/update initial skeleton (from an existing example) ... ok, started from current code/skeleton of my repo [fastify-example](https://github.com/smartiniOnGitHub/fastify-example), today is 2020-06-02
* [x] general: setup project with TypeScript, and add dependencies; check if continue in a similar way of fastify-example, or instead on top of a skeleton generated by fastify cli, and update/adapt it ... start as suggested by Fastify official documentation: [TypeScript - Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/docs/TypeScript.md) ... ok
* [x] general: configure TypeScript to output modern js compatible with Node.js minimal version set here (at the moment Node.js 10 LTS), so at least ES2017; and into the '/dist' folder; see [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) for TypeScript compiler options in the 'tsconfig.json' file, and [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) for TypeScript compiler options via command-line (CLI) ... ok, and note that I specified ts output folder in root 'tsconfig.json' file, and even in 'package.json' (but here mainly to have more evidence on the output folder, used there even in other npm custom commands)
* [x] general: rename initial 'server.ts' into 'server-simple.ts', and keep it as a minimal/initial but working example ... ok, but duplicated for now; to resolve TypeScript errors update project config
